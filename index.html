<!-- 
Home Page:
-- The page should have a heading that should indicate your name and that this is your portfolio website.
-- It should also contain the navigation bar listing the three pages [this nav bar must be present in all
pages]
-- It should have an image of you [or an avatar image of you]
-- Below the image, you should give a quotation from some personality that resonates with you. This
quote must be indented in the page without using any styling rules.
-- Then, the page should have a brief paragraph or two introducing yourself to your audience. This is
sometimes called an elevator pitch. Tell them who you are where are you from (little bit of your
background), what is your current professional affiliation, what are your prior professional and what are
your future professional interest. This content should be ended by linking to your other two pages by
stating something like - "to know more about me check out my Page2 and Page3".
-- A progress bar or a meter bar showing how many degree credits you have taken/away from
graduation. (For example, you have taken 100 course credits out of 130 to get a B.S. degree – and
represent this using a progress bar)[This is an applied task, I want you to you all to research and
implement this.]
-- At the bottom of the page, you should specify your copyright information; your email; any other social
media sites that you want people to know of. This portion of the content should be separated from rest
of the content using a horizontal rule/line that should be visible on the page.
