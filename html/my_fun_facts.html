home page
√-- It should also contain the navigation bar listing the three pages, as you have for your home page
√-- The heading of the page should be as follows - "Some fun facts about me"

The rest of the content of this page must have three independent segments where you will specify the
following:
√-- Your [current] favorite book title, with its cover image, link to where readers can purchase the book
(Amazon.com, Kindle etc.), and a short description in your words what you like about the book.

different webpage window cleanly embedded within your webpage. Although styling is not required,
you must take care of structuring your content/html elements, which can be done using html attributes.

                is a science fiction novel by Ernest Cline. It takes place in the year 2045, where the world is in
                shambles and people escape their reality by playing a virtual reality game called the OASIS. The
                creator of the OASIS, James Halliday, dies and leaves his fortune to whoever can find the Easter Egg
                hidden in the game. The story follows Wade Watts, a teenager who is obsessed with the OASIS and
                Halliday, as he tries to find the Easter Egg before the evil corporation IOI does.

                <a href="https://youtu.be/7fFYtnfOdAI">Sinkholes of Darkness</a> is a song from the video game
                Terraria, and is found in the Terraria (Otherworld) Soundtrack. It plays while fighting some of the hardmode bosses when the Terraria Otherworld soundtrack is selected. Personally, I think this is one of the cooler sounding songs in the game.
